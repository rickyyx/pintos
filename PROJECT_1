<thread.h>
struct thread {
+    int64_t wake_up_time;               /* Wake up time from sleep */
+    struct list_elem sleep_elem;        /* Sleep List element */
}

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

It will put the current thread to the wait_list;
then blocked the current thread by calling thread_block();

thread_sleep():
- get current thread
- disable interrupt 
- calculate wake up ticks 
- push the thread to the sleep_list
- thread_block()
- [after returned]
- enable interrupt



>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

Nothing extra is added in the timer interrupt handler. 

In schedule(), The sleep_list is sorted, with the earliest ot be wake up at the begining. So at each timer interrupt, it is not needed to iterate through the whole list. 


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?
Interrupt is disabled before any critical instructions. So only one thread is allowed to access the wait_thread and modify it at one time.

[Question]
However, in a SMP multithreaded machine, synchronization on the sleep_list is needed if it is a global object? 

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

Interrupt will be disabled in critical steps. 


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

Alternative 1:
Leave the thread in the ready_list, and check each of them when considering which one to run by the scheduler. 
--
Current implementation is better in this design since it does not mess up with the ready_list. 

Alternative 2: 
Use an unsorted sleep_list. This will result O(n) in every single invocation of the timer interrupt. 
--
Current implementation has greater cost on inserting element into the list. But allows O(1) for removal and avoids unnecessary iterations during timer interrupt. So it will be better with more frequent timer interrupts and less invocations of timer_sleep()

Alternative 3: 
Waking up threads in every timer interrupt. 
--
This will incurs greater cost from checking the sleep_list more frequently.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

The waiters list of the semaphore will be sorted with priority in descending order. 
So the removal from the front will always be the one with the highest priority. 


>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

1. IF NOT a free lock:
2.   recursively donate priority to holder, and holder's donees as well.
     (however, donor-donee relationship is not propogated recursively)
3. ELSE:
4.    do nothing 
5.Sema_down on lock's semaphore
(Got the lock)
6. Set the lock's holder

** Handling nested donation 
priority donation will be propogated through the holder's chain. The current
lock holder will have its priority changed.   
If the lock holder is locked by another lock LK, LK's current holder will 
recursively change its priority as well. 
If the lock holder is currently in the ready list, it needs to be re-queued 
to reflect change of the priority.


>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

a. When higher-priority thread is waiting for the lock
1. Remove all those threads waiting for the same lock(aka, threads in the waiter
   list of the semaphore) from the thread's donors
2. Wake up a thread 
(It might get yielded before returning from sema_up) 

b. When lower-priority thread is waiting for it. 
Same thing happens.

c. When no thread waiting for it. 
Then no thread will be deleted from its donors list


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

thread_set_priority() will cause a re-ordering of the ready_list. 
A lock on the read_list could be used to synchronize the modifications. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

The tracking of ready threads in the run queue could be further improved
with a bit vector that tracks the emptiness of the queue. Also the number of ready threads could be tracked by a count, which needs to be syncronized if there are multiple threads running at the same time. (eg, multi-core processors)

Yes. For example, the sequence of each update at each time tick. 
Is load_avg updated before recent_cpu? 

My rule follows as such:
laod_avg -> all recent_cpu -> all priority -> current recent_cpu


>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code

Following the original design. Calculation happens at each timer tick. 
However, the ready threads number could be updated outside of interrupt
context, which is an optimization can be made to shorten the time spent
in the context.

- Improving on the data strucutre used to track the run queue is 
  is definitely one optimization can be made. With a 64 bit int
  tracking the emptiness of each run queue should improve time spent on
  finding out the maximal priority

- Improving on the tracking of ready counts will be another. 
  It was not implemented due ot extra complixity in initiation the thread
  system.

- Macros are used to perform the fixed-point math in fpoint.h. Since 
  each operation is relatively simple. Macros are faster than functions
  since they do not invoke function calling routines.
